<p>CAR is the online edition of CAR Magazine, Britain’s oldest monthly motoring mag.
 
It’s the UK’s best and fastest online motoring news service,  providing a constant stream of scoops, first drives and official pictures of new cars. There's also opinion galore, blogs, video content and a community area, as well as our legendary GBU data section – The Good, The Bad and the Ugly – identifying the car industry’s heroes and zeros.
 
Initially launched on 1 August 2007, CAR Online currently reaches around half a million unique users a month, generating millions of page impressions. The website is run by Tim Pollard, CAR’s associate editor.

<p>CAR Magazine is published on one of the middle Wednesdays each month, by Bauer Automotive. CAR originally launched in 1962 as Small Car and Mini Owner, swiftly expanding its focus and simply becoming CAR. 

The magazine has a history of innovation. We invented the group test, pioneered the drive story and coined the phrase 'supercar' – and all three remain staples of CAR. The magazine is also renowned for its photography, writing and design: in 2007, CAR won two top design awards and one of our writers recently won the UK's Journalist of the Year gong from the Guild of Motoring Writers. From LJK Setright to Gavin Green and Georg Kacher, ours are some of the world's most respected automotive journalists.
 
And CAR is global. As well as CAR Online and the UK magazine, we have 14 foreign editions: Brazil, China, Greece, India, Italy, Mexico, Middle East, New Zealand, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Turkey and Ukraine. Through all its media, CAR interacts with more than 650,000 consumers each month.
 
For the definitive view on all things automotive, get CAR.
