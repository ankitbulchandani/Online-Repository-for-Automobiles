<p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited engineers, manufactures and distributes luxury automobiles and automobile parts worldwide.
 Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG established in 1998 after BMW licensed the rights to 
the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo from Rolls-Royce PLC and acquired the rights to the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grill
 shape trademarks from Volkswagen AG. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited operates from purpose built administrative and production facilities
 opened in 2003 across from the historic Goodwood Circuit in Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom. Rolls-Royce Motors Cars Limited 
is the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce branded motor cars since 2003. </p>

<p>Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use since 1906, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship to Rolls-Royce
 branded vehicles produced prior to 2003. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to Rolls-Royce Motors and various other
 predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started
 producing cars under the Rolls-Royce brand.
</p>
<p>The Rolls-Royce Phantom 4-door sedan was the first product offered for sale in 2003. Since then, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has expanded 
its product line up to include an extended wheelbase version of the Phantom sedan, a Phantom 2-door coupé and Phantom convertible version
and the less expensive Ghost 4-door sedan and Wraith 2-door coupé.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG in 1998 after BMW licensed the rights to the Rolls-Royce
 brand name and logo from Rolls-Royce PLC and acquired the rights to the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grill shape trademarks from Volkswagen AG.
 Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited has been manufacturing Rolls-Royce branded cars since 2003.</p>

<p>Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use on vehicles since 1906, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship
 to Rolls-Royce branded vehicles produced prior to 2003. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to
 Rolls-Royce Motors and the other various predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the foundation of each company and 2003.
Ownership and licensing of trademarks</p>

<p>In 1998, Vickers decided to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. The most likely buyer was BMW, who already supplied engines and other components 
for Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, but BMW's final offer of £340 million was beaten by Volkswagen's £430m.</p>

<p>A stipulation in the ownership documents of Rolls-Royce dictated that Rolls-Royce plc, the aero-engine maker would retain certain 
essential trademarks, including the Rolls-Royce name and logo if the automotive division was sold. Although Vickers plc sold the vehicle
 designs, nameplates, administrative headquarters, production facilities, Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grill shape trademarks to 
Volkswagen AG, Rolls-Royce plc chose to license the Rolls-Royce name and logo to BMW AG for £40m, because Rolls-Royce plc
 had recently had joint business ventures with BMW.</p>

<p>BMW's contract to supply engines and components to Rolls-Royce Motors allowed BMW to cancel the contract with 12 month's notice. 
Volkswagen would be unable to re-engineer the Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles to use other engines within that time frame.
 With the Rolls-Royce brand identification marks split between the two companies and Volkswagen's engine supply in jeopardy, the two companies entered into negotiations.</p>

<p>Volkswagen agreed to sell BMW the Spirit of Ecstasy and grill shape trandemarks and BMW agreed to continue supplying engines and components until 2003.
 Volkswagen continued to produce Rolls-Royce branded vehicles between 1998 and 2003, giving BMW time to build a new
 Rolls-Royce administrative headquarters and production facility on the Goodwood Estate near Chichester, 
West Sussex and develop the Phantom, the first Rolls-Royce from the new company.</p>
 Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited became the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce branded cars in 2003.
